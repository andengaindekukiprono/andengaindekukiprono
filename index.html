            <p id="p1">Mathematics is a broad field that deals with the study of numbers, quantities, shapes, structures, patterns, and their relationships. It is a fundamental part of human knowledge and plays a crucial role in various scientific, engineering, economic, and practical applications.
              Here are some key branches of mathematics:  </p>
             <p id="p2">
        Arithmetic: The basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with properties of numbers.
             </p>
             <p id="p3">  Algebra: The study of mathematical symbols and rules for manipulating them to solve equations and analyze mathematical structures.
            </p>
             <p id="p4"> Geometry: The study of shapes, sizes, and properties of space. It includes Euclidean geometry, trigonometry, and other geometrical concepts.
           </p>
        <main>
             <p id="p5">Calculus: Developed by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, calculus deals with the study of change and motion. It includes differential calculus (concerned with rates of change) and integral calculus (concerned with accumulation).
            </p>
             <p id="p6"> Statistics: The collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It includes probability theory, which is essential in understanding uncertainty and randomness.
            </p>

           <p id="p7">Number Theory: The study of integers and their properties, including prime numbers and divisibility.
            </p>
           <p id="p8">Linear Algebra: The study of vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces. It has applications in various fields like physics, computer science, and engineering.
            </p></main>
           <p>Discrete Mathematics: The study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. It includes topics like combinatorics, graph theory, and logic.
            </p>
           <p id="p9"> 
            Differential Equations: Equations that involve derivatives, describing how a quantity changes in relation to other variables. It is used in modeling various phenomena in physics, engineering, and biology.
            </p>
           
            <p id="p10">Topology: The study of properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching or bending.
            </p>
            
            <p id="p11">These branches often overlap, and advancements in one area can have implications in others. Mathematics is not only a theoretical pursuit but also a practical tool used in various fields to model, analyze, and solve real-world problems.
